            Lynxtool's aim is to help non-programmers process complex data by
            showing them what is going on. Instead of having to simulate the
            effects of code in their heads, we draw it out for them.

            A core feature of computational instructions is the ability to do
            different things under different conditions. In the example below,
            we'll send a different message to your courier depending on the day
            the delivery was made.

            The top pair of inputs are values to be returned if the condition is
            <i>true</i>. The conditional input is in the middle, and everything
            below is the values to be returned if the condition is <i>false</i>.

            As the a basic part of computation our conditional node should be
            simple but was not. It was confusing because there's too many things
            to plug into and coming out of it.

            Furthermore, our design philosophy had evolved since this node was
            initially created. We wanted users to learn by example, so instead
            of just creating single nodes, we plan to allow users to insert a
            cluster of nodes together. We want to users how to express complex
            ideas with simple nodes.

            For example, let's say we tip extra on the weekends. So we can
            extend that node to also include the percent to add to the delivery
            cost.

            Original nodes try to do a lot, our direction has changed. We want
            users to be able to learn the tool by playing around with a cluster
            of nodes. But we want to keep nodes atomic, an expression of a
            programming concept as simple as possible.<br /><br />Nodes
            constructed together can express more complex concepts. And the same
            can be done with the old Conditional node by combining it with the
            Pack and Unpack nodes

            stand out better.

            and hypothesize it will be a likely use case.

            I also ended up being the one to implement our new conditional node
            design. A fun part of coding here was I had to brush up on
            trigonometry to calculate where to draw the points so the lines will
            align pixel perfectly when they meet.
