					<h2>Users have trouble getting around in their code base</h2>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405334" width="640" height="364" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Dark lays it's structural elements (code and data schemas) in floating boxes with no order to them. Users spend alot of time panning, dragging, jumping around their project space.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Problem 1: Checking up on DB schemas</h3>
					<p>Users spend a lot of time dragging databses close to the code the code chunks that uses it. Because <code>DB::set</code> requires the data inserted to match the schema exactly.</p>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405240" width="505" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>When their function references a DB it is even worse! Since functions are in their own seperate space, users must to go back to the main space to see the DB schema. They must either have fantastic short term memory, or take a screenshot of the DB double check their code.</p>

					<h3>Problem 2: Working with functions</h3>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435578880" width="727" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Users can create functions, which will be accessible throughout their own project. But these functions are accessible within the main space; they exist in their own little world isolation. They are not accessible from the code that uses it, and only reached through clicking on a link in the sidebar.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Problem 3: Understanding workers</h3>
					<p>Workers are like async functions that live in the main space. But that doesn't make working with them any easier.</p>
					<img src="worker_diff_inputs.gif" style="height: 200px; width: auto;" />
					<p> Unlike functions they take only one argument <code>event</code> of type Any. The user has to drag them near their code to determine its expected input is, just like DBs. But unlike DBs, which have a set schema, the user must read through the code to figure out what is the expected type and structure of the input.</p>

					><h2>How did we get here?</h2>
					<q>Problems we face today are created by people in the past with the best intentions</q>
					
					<p>The founder's vision for Dark is to bring data into development. He would start off with "imagine a city, where you have boroughs and neighborhoods...", he wanted constructs in Dark to be laid out as if they are on a map. The value of Dark is it would show users' live (or cumulative) traffic as it flowed through the codebase.</p>

					<p class="fragment">The floating boxes (of code and DBs) are one day suppose to have dots/lines flowing between them to show user live traffic. They will organize code for developers instead of having files. File systems, he theorized, are arbitrary ways of splitting code. It gives developers more problems to worry about, such as dependency cycles.</p>
				</section>

					<h4>Let's think through the city analogy</h4>
					<div class="side-by-side">
						<img src="dresden_map.png" />
						<img src="habits_map.jpg" />
					</div>
					<small>Here we have a map of my favorite European city, Dresden (left) and the architecture diagram of simple habits tracker app (right).</small>
					<p>If the endpoints and datastores are points of interest, then the paths data may take are streets and highways.</p>

					<div class="side-by-side">

					<small>Google maps shows congestion. The API traffic map shows density of requests passing through endpoints and into databases.</small>

					<p>Over time we can construct a cumulative flow of illustrate the popularity of certain paths. The developer will know which parts of the code base, they should devote more resources to.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Unfortunately, most of our users don't have live traffic yet*</h4>

					<p>for the traffic feature to be useful. They find Dark such a frustrating experience they never finish their projects.</p>

					<img src="overlap.png" />

					<p>They struggle understand what is going on in their codebase because everything is too disorganized.</p>

					<p><small>At the time of this project (early 2019). Now we have many users with live traffic</small></p>

						<h2>First, we must pave the streets</h2>
						How can we help developers understand their code base? So they may  write, debug, and edit code with ease?

						<hr />

						<p class="fragment">For this case study, we'll be using a simple habits tracker application. <br />
							The you sets a weekly goal for how many times you want to do the activity (ie: run 3 times a week). When you update with a habit done, the API checks to see if you've reached your goal. If you have, you'll get a text with a cute meme, otherwise you'll just get an motivational quote instead.

					What to show? (Street signs... "Traffic light in 400 km")
					A well planned city are designed with the behavior of it's residents in mind.
					Let's look at our users.
					
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405240" width="640" height="564" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					- Drag dbs around to check schema
					- Drag worker's around to see expected object
					- Keep going to Fns to see what it does to your data (and also params at that time was not showing in the docstrings)
				</section>
				<section id="design">
					Proposed Solution!
					<!-- IMG from previous wireframe now show with data -->
					Interactive example. HTTP -> Worker -> Fn
					<!-- GIF expand references on hover (and highligh where it's used in code) -->
					<!-- GIF focus on click into, with it's own references and moving over -->
				</section>
				<section>
					Constraint! Live values
					<!-- IMG of live values on the left -->
				</section>
				<section>
					Patch up constraint. Just use backwards and foward arrows.
					<!-- IMG screencap what we have for references now -->
				</section>
				<section id="build">
					MVP: Scope cuts
					- Don't show the worker's event expected shape (because it involves complex programming)
					- Don't expand functions or other code, and just link to it.
				</section>
				<section id="test">
					Testing!
					Over users loved it. We learned references also provide them a useful way to depreciate (DBs, functions, etc.)

					But they didn't like:
					- functions going to another place entirely, and not being able to see code side by side.
					- The arrows are a little too subtle.
				</section>
				<section>
					Since the side by side is a result of scope cut. we do plan to have it eventually, let's focus on our poor solution to LVs.
				</section>
				<section>
					<!-- IMG color refboxes differently -->
					1. Easiest (color the arrows differently)
					<!-- IMG fade out incoming to show live values -->
					2. Fade away incoming referneces if editing (place them as top bread crumbs)
					<!-- GIF Lv top with drop shadow, and expanding if needed -->
					3. Move live values to above the cursor
				</section>
				<section>Retrospective
					- considered constraints first
					- should have fought harder for viewing functions side by side
					- Have a plan to figure out when we will bring the learnings and follow up changes instead of leaving them hanging as just vaporware.
