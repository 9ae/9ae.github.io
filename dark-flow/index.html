					<h2>Developers have trouble getting around in their code base</h2>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405334" width="640" height="364" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Dark lays it's structural elements (code and data schemas) in floating boxes with no order to them. Developers spend alot of time panning, dragging, jumping around their project space. <em>Why do they do that?</em></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1. To check up on DB schemas</h3>
					<p>Developers spend a lot of time dragging databses close to the code that uses it. Because <code>DB::set</code> requires the data inserted to match the schema exactly.</p>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405240" width="505" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>When a function references a DB that experience is is even worse! Since functions are in their own seperate space, developers must to go back to the main space to see the DB schema. They must either have fantastic short term memory, or take a screenshot of the DB double check their code.</p>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435577183" width="450" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

					<h3>2. To read/write in functions</h3>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435578880" width="727" height="300" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Developers can create functions, which will be accessible throughout their own project. But these functions are NOT accessible within the main space; they exist in their own little world. Functions are not accessible from the code that uses it, and only reached through clicking on a link in the sidebar.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. To understand workers</h3>
					<p>Workers are like async functions, which appears in the main space. But that doesn't make working with them any easier.</p>
					<img src="worker_diff_inputs.gif" style="height: 200px; width: auto;" />
					<p> Unlike functions they take only one argument <code>event</code> of type Any. The developer has to drag them near their code to determine its expected input, just like DBs. But unlike DBs, which have a set schema, the developer must read through the code to figure out what is the expected type and structure of the input.</p>

					><h2>How did we get here?</h2>
					<q>Problems we face today are created by people in the past with the best intentions</q>
					
					<p>The founder's vision for Dark is to bring data into development. He would start off with "imagine a city, where you have boroughs and neighborhoods...", he wanted constructs in Dark to be laid out as if they are on a map. The value of Dark is it would show users' live (or cumulative) traffic as it flowed through the codebase.</p>

					<p class="fragment">The floating boxes (of code and DBs) are one day suppose to have dots/lines flowing between them to show user live traffic. They will organize code for developers instead of having files. File systems, he theorized, are arbitrary ways of splitting code. It gives developers more problems to worry about, such as dependency cycles.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Let's think through the city analogy</h4>
					<div class="side-by-side">
						<img src="dresden_map.png" />
						<img src="habits_map.jpg" />
					</div>
					<small>Here we have a map of my favorite European city, Dresden (left) and the architecture diagram of simple habits tracker app (right).</small>
					<p>If the endpoints and datastores are points of interest, then the paths data may take are streets and highways.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<div class="side-by-side">
						<img src="dresden_path.png" />
						<img src="habits_path.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p>The path a single trace will take is a trip.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div class="side-by-side">

						<img src="habits_traffic.jpg" />
					</div>
					<small>Google maps shows congestion. The API traffic map shows density of requests passing through endpoints and into databases.</small>

					<p>Over time we can construct a cumulative flow of illustrate the popularity of certain paths. The developer will know which parts of the code base, they should devote more resources to.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Unfortunately, most of our users don't have live traffic yet*</h4>

					<p>for the traffic feature to be useful. They find Dark such a frustrating experience they never finish their projects.</p>

					<img src="overlap.png" />

					<p>They struggle understand what is going on in their codebase because everything is too disorganized.</p>

					<p><small>At the time of this project (early 2019). Now we have many users with live traffic</small></p>

						<h2>First, we must pave the streets</h2>
						How can we help developers understand their code base? So they may  write, debug, and edit code with ease?

						<hr />

						<p class="fragment">For this case study, we'll be using a simple habits tracker application. <br />
							The you sets a weekly goal for how many times you want to do the activity (ie: run 3 times a week). When you update with a habit done, the API checks to see if you've reached your goal. If you have, you'll get a text with a cute meme, otherwise you'll just get an motivational quote instead.
						</p>
				</section>
				<section id="ideate">
						<h2>City planning!</h2>

						<ul>In order to create a useful interface for writing & editing code, we must answer the following questions:
							<li>What are all the possible paths a trace can take once an endpoint recieves the data?</li>
							<li>How do we show the navigation of the through these paths?</li>
							<li>What do information should be available for each component type?</li>
						</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Let's consider one path</h3>
					<img src="path.png" style="height: 50px;" />
					<p><code>POST /track</code> gets hit it when you've completed a habit. Most of the execution is offloaded to a queue (the <code>"didHabit" worker</code>). The worker will add an entry to the <code>Tracker DB</code>, and <em>send you a meme</em> if you've meet your weekly goal.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="path.png" style="height: 50px;" />
					<h4>Adding points along the path</h4>
					<table>
						<tr><td style="padding: 0; height:315px;"><img src="start-path-1.png" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" /></td><td style="padding: 0; height:315px;"><img src="start-path-2.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;"/></td></tr>
					</table>

					<p>We start off with <code>POST /track</code>, its code it references <code>Habits DB</code> with <code>DB::get</code>. And emits an event to <code>"didHabit" worker</code>. <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">So we add them as references. <em>References allow the developer to preview or go down the path in their program's control flow.</em></span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="path.png" style="height: 50px;" />
					<h4>Seeing ahead</h4>
					<img src="expand-worker.png" />
					<p>When the developer hovers over a reference that contains code (functions and workers), they will be able to see a preview of the code. Just like when your GPS tells you "in 500 km turn right into Blueberry Lane".</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="path.png" style="height: 50px;" />
					<h4>Going down the path</h4>
					<img src="focus-worker.png" />
					<small>With <code>didHabit worker</code> in focus, the developer should still see most of <code>POST /track</code>. The fade out on the left side is for aesthetic balance on this slide show.</small>

					<p>When they click into the reference, the screen now show all its contents and focus on it. Adding its own references to the right. In our navigation analogy, you have made your turn and now directions for the next steps are visible. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<q>Are we there yet?</q>
					
					<p>Have we mapped out all the paths we want to capture? When <code>POST /track</code> gets hit, most of its execution is offloaded to a queue (the <code>"didHabit" worker</code>). The worker will add an entry to the <code>Tracker DB</code>, and <em>send you a meme</em> if you've meet your weekly goal.<p>

					<table style="width: 100%;">

				<section>
					<p>Seems like they are in functions. One of the problems our developers face is:</p>
					<blockquote><small>Functions are NOT accessible within the main space; they exist in their own little world. Functions are not accessible from the code that uses it, and only reached through clicking on a link in the sidebar.</small></blockquote>

					What to show? (Street signs... "Rest Stop in 400 km. Has gas station, Wendy's etc.")
					Not the POI, but an abstraction of the POI that would be of interest for you.

					A well planned city are designed with the behavior of it's residents in mind.
					Let's look at our users.
					
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/435405240" width="640" height="564" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					- Drag dbs around to check schema
					- Drag worker's around to see expected object
					- Keep going to Fns to see what it does to your data (and also params at that time was not showing in the docstrings)
				</section>
				<section id="design">
					Proposed Solution!
					<!-- IMG from previous wireframe now show with data -->
					Interactive example. HTTP -> Worker -> Fn
					<!-- GIF expand references on hover (and highligh where it's used in code) -->
					<!-- GIF focus on click into, with it's own references and moving over -->
				</section>
				<section>
					Constraint! Live values
					<!-- IMG of live values on the left -->
				</section>
				<section>
					Patch up constraint. Just use backwards and foward arrows.
					<!-- IMG screencap what we have for references now -->
				</section>
				<section id="build">
					MVP: Scope cuts
					- Don't show the worker's event expected shape (because it involves complex programming)
					- Don't expand functions or other code, and just link to it.
				</section>
				<section id="test">
					Testing!
					Over users loved it. We learned references also provide them a useful way to depreciate (DBs, functions, etc.)

					But they didn't like:
					- functions going to another place entirely, and not being able to see code side by side.
					- The arrows are a little too subtle.
				</section>
				<section>
					Since the side by side is a result of scope cut. we do plan to have it eventually, let's focus on our poor solution to LVs.
				</section>
				<section>
					<!-- IMG color refboxes differently -->
					1. Easiest (color the arrows differently)
					<!-- IMG fade out incoming to show live values -->
					2. Fade away incoming referneces if editing (place them as top bread crumbs)
					<!-- GIF Lv top with drop shadow, and expanding if needed -->
					3. Move live values to above the cursor
				</section>
				<section>Retrospective
					- considered constraints first
					- should have fought harder for viewing functions side by side
					- Have a plan to figure out when we will bring the learnings and follow up changes instead of leaving them hanging as just vaporware.
