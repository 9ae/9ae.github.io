				<section id="empathize"><p>Dark was first built for one developer. But developers normally work in teams, and we struggled to get larger projects onboard because of our lack of support for a team's workflow.</p>
				<p class="fragment">For a New Year's hack day, I looked into what are the steps necessary to give us a UI for enabling users to collaborate with each.</p>
				</section>
				<section><h2>The Problem</h2>
				<blockquote>Multiple developers will struggle to work on the same project because they don't know <span class="font-blue">who</span> made <span class="font-pink">what</span> changes where and <span class="font-green">how</span> they made it.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section id="breakdown"><h3>Let's breakdown it down</h3>
					<ol>For teamwork to be possible within the editor, developers need to be able to:
					<li class="fragment">Learn about the codebase's history. <span class="page-only">They should be able to find out who to ask for help.</span></li>
					<li class="fragment">Communicate about their code in the editor.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Make changes to their codebase without changing production. <span class="page-only">They need to package their changes for another to review or a deploy.</span></li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Out of scope</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Why we solve to solve those three problems and not others?</aside>
					<ul>Other concerns I thought of but tabled were:
						<li class="fragment"><em>Merge conflicts</em><span class="page-only">- there might be some usability issues we need to consider later. Our main bottleneck is a backend engineering concern.</span></li>
						<li class="fragment"><em>Pair-programming</em><span class="page-only"> - maybe something down the line. Right now developers will have to do it through a third party voice/video service.</span></li>
						<li class="fragment"><em>Forking and contributing common code</em><span class="page-only"> - to be addressed with our package manager and embed darklang code project. Right now we will focus on users working on the same project.</span></li></ul>

								<section id="solve2">
									<h2>Solving: What does this code do?</h2>
									<blockquote>Developers need to be able to communicate about their code in the editor.</blockquote>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Constraints</h3>
									<p>Right now the only way for users to add comments in their code is with unassigned strings.</p>
									<img src="teamwork-2-a.png" style="height:250px; width:auto;" />
									<aside class="notes">Comments are done by just having string literals, there is no clear visual distinction between them and other strings in the code.</aside>
									<p><em>It is a workaround hack; not a language feature</em></p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h4>Can we have simply implement comments?</h4>
									<p> Maybe make <code>#</code> a keyword to create a comment line or block? We can but it will go against our founder's language design principle.</p>
				
				<p class="fragment">In which it states, content not core to the main flow logic of the code should not expand the code vertically. This is why we have <a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/unique-aspects#functions-that-use-error-rail" target="_blank">Error Rails</a>, instead of letting developers do their own error handling within the main flow of the logic.</p>
				
				<p class="fragment"><em>How can we allow for users to add comments to their code?</em></p>
								</section>
								<section><h3>Reflective understanding</h3>
									<ul>People use comments for 2 reasons:
				
				<li>To communicate about a complex chunk of code in a natural language.</li>
				<li>To temporarily disable a chunk of code during execution. <span class="page-only">This can already be achieved with <a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/feature-flags" target="_blank">Feature Flags</a>.</span></li></ul>
				
				<aside class="notes">We can ignore the second reason for now since it is addressed by an existing feature. Let's focus on the first use case adding meta-information about the code to the code.</aside>
								</section>
								<section><h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
									<aside class="notes">Dark has borrowed many ideas from document editor experiences. I think like Airtable is trying to bring the power of databases to the general public by making it appear like a spreadsheet. Dark aims to democratize coding by borrowing rich text editing experiences; instead of solely deriving from the text editors developers use to write code.</aside>
									<p><em>Why don't we take page from collaborative document editing software?</em></p>
									<img src="teamwork-2-b.png" />
									<aside class="notes">The comments will appear to the side of the document without obstructing the reading experience of the main document.</aside>
								</section>
								<section  data-background-color="#efeff4"><h3>Solution</h3>
									<p class="font-blue">When the developer selects a code chunk they can add a comment to it.</p>
									<img src="select_code.png"  class="light" />
								</section>
								<section  data-background-color="#efeff4">
									<p class="font-blue">They can type in a comment and collapse to hide it.</p>
									<img src="comment-opened.png"  class="light" />
								</section>
								<section  data-background-color="#efeff4">
									<p class="font-blue">Collapsed comment will just show as a marker, and be read on click.</p>

					<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
					Borrowing from image editing...

					<blockquote><em>Introducting Layers!</em> As we add more features to Dark, we must give affordances for users to see different things, when performing different tasks. Not everything needs to be on the screen at all once. Layers help us reduce visual noise and solves out our no-space problem.

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Dark lacks the traditional git branches frequently in most contemporary code bases. It is difficult for users to make changes in their code base that won't immediately affect production.</aside>
					<p><a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/feature-flags" target="_blank">Feature Flags</a> provide a method developers can change and test out their code, before enabling it for all their users. But as of now, they can only flag individual chunks of code at a time.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>But new features or fixes often span across multiple parts of the codebase.</h4>
					<aside class="notes">For example, let's say they add a new field to a database. They have to update POST endpoints to include the new field as input. Anywhere that performs <code>SELECT *</code> on the schema will have to handle the new column being fetched.</aside>
					<p>We need a way for developers to batch changes together.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>How can we extend feature flags to group changes together and allow someone to review all changes associated with the new feature?</h4>
					<ol>To do so it would need to do two things:
					<li>Provide support for batching changes under a single feature flag.</li>
					<li>Provide support to review the changes in in a feature flag<span class="page-only">, UI to request changes or approve changes. And also support for deploying changes either immediately on on a gradual basis.</span></li>

						<li><b>Gradual rollout</b><span class="page-only"> will first execute this code for a certain percent of grandusers, and slowly increasing the percent until 100%. At any point during this rollout process, if reports of errors or other problems occur, developers may pause this rollout process.</span></li>

					<li><b>Scheduled rollout</b><span class="page-only"> will have all 100% of grandusers use the new code at a specific date-time. ie: The hour of a week when granduser traffic is at lowest.</span></li>

					<li><b>Immediate rollout</b><span class="page-only"> will have Dark deploy the new code ASAP as soon as the developer clicks the button.</span></li>

					<h2>Future Considerations</h2>

<ul>We cut scope on this to get out the best ideas within a day. There are additional considerations that would be taken into account in the next phases:
<li>How do developers set the conditions in which the execution engine should run the flagged version vs production version?</li>
<li>Who has permission to review?</li>
<li>Are we going to keep the feature flags as is?</li>
<li>How do we reverse or halt the deployment of a feature flag?</li>
<li>Will developers want stricter permissions on who can amend to another's feature flag?</li>
<li>What should be the UI for gradual and scheduled rollout?</li>
