				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					Dark was first built for one user. But developers normally work in teams, and we struggled to get larger
					projects
					onboard because of our lack of support for a team's workflow.
				</aside>
				<blockquote>Multiple users will struggle to work on the same project because they don't know <span
						class="font-blue">who</span> made <span class="font-pink">what</span> changes where and <span
						class="font-green">why</span>.</blockquote>
				<p class="fragment">For a New Year's hack day, I explored ideas around the theme of collaboration. What features
					can help users communicate and work together on the same codebase.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="breakdown">
				<h3>Let's breakdown it down</h3>
				<ol>For teamwork to be possible in Dark, users need to be able to:
					<li class="fragment">Communicate about their code in the editor.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Learn about the codebase's history.<aside class="notes inline"> They should be able to
							find out who to ask for help.</aside>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Make changes to their codebase safely. <aside class="notes inline">
							They need to package their changes for another person to review or deploy.</span></li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Out of scope</h3>
				<aside class="notes">Why we solve to solve those three problems and not others?</aside>
				<ul>Other concerns I thought of but tabled were:
					<li class="fragment">Merge conflicts<aside class="notes inline"> - there might be some usability issues we
							need to consider later. With how users will deal with merge conflicts within Dark. But the main bottleneck
							holding us back from was a backend engineering concern.</aside>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Pair-programming<aside class="notes inline"> - maybe something down the line. Right now
							users will have to do it through a third party voice/video service. People have actually paired in Dark
							with
							eachother on a Twitch live stream.</aside>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Forking and sharing code<aside class="notes inline"> - to be addressed with
							our package manager.</aside>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<!-- Goal 2 -->
			<section id="solve2">
				<h2>Solving: How do I talk about my code?</h2>
				<blockquote>Users need to be able to communicate about their code in the editor.</blockquote>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Constraints</h3>
				<p>Right now the only way for users to add comments in their code is with unassigned strings.</p>
				<img src="teamwork-2-a.png" style="height:250px; width:auto;" />
				<aside class="notes">Comments are done by just having string literals, there is no clear visual distinction
					between them and other strings in the code.</aside>
				<p class="center"><em>It is a workaround hack; not a language feature</em>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Can we have simply implement comments?</h4>
				<p> Maybe make <code>#</code> a keyword to create a comment line or block?</p>
				<p class="fragment">But it will violate our founder's language design principle.
				<aside class="notes inline">
					Which states, content not essential to understanding logic of the code should not expand the code vertically.
					This is why we have <a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/unique-aspects#functions-that-use-error-rail"
						target="_blank">Error Rails</a>, instead of letting users do their own error handling within the main
					body.</aside>
				</p>

				<p class="fragment"><em>How can we allow for users to add comments to their code?</em></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Reflective understanding</h3>
				<ul>People use comments for 2 reasons:

					<li>To communicate about a complex chunk of code in a natural language.</li>
					<li>To temporarily disable a chunk of code during execution. <aside class="notes inline">This can already be
							achieved with <a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/feature-flags" target="_blank">Feature Flags</a>,
							which we have. And I'll talk more about those later on.
						</aside>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">Let's
					focus on the first use case adding, meta-information about the code to communicate with another person reading
					it.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
				<aside class="notes">Dark has borrowed many ideas from document editor experiences. I think like Airtable is
					trying to bring the power of databases to the general public by making it appear like a spreadsheet. We aims
					to democratize coding by borrowing rich text editing experiences; instead of solely deriving from the text
					editors developers use.</aside>
				<p>Why don't we take page from collaborative document editing software?</p>
				<div class="fragment">
					<img src="teamwork-2-b.png" />
					<aside class="notes">The comments will appear to the side of the document without obstructing the reading
						experience of the main document.</aside>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section data-background-color="#efeff4" class="light">
				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p class="center">When the user selects a code chunk they can add a comment to it.</p>
				<img src="select_code.png" class="light" />
			</section>
			<section data-background-color="#efeff4" class="light">
				<p class="center">They can type in a comment and collapse to hide it.</p>

				<p>With the popular demand for collaboration features, we have the ability to see other users who are on the

			<section>
				<h3>Space Constraints</h3>
				<p>Can we just keep the avatars there? Even if a users is not active? How can we show that information without
					adding more clutter?</p>

				<img src="teamwork-1-a.png" />
				<aside class="notes">All around your code, there's already alot going on! Above is the documentation box. To the
					left is live values, the right side has references
					(and also sometimes feature flags), below is the evaluated return value. For over a year our product has been
					struggling with limited dimensionality. In multiple instances, colleagues and I have been proposing having
					different modes in which only certain things will be visible.</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
				Borrowing from image editing software...

				<blockquote><em>What about layers!</em> As we add more features to Dark, we must give affordances for users to
					see different things, when performing different tasks. Not everything needs to be on the screen at all once.
					Layers help us reduce visual noise and addresses our running out of space problem.
				</blockquote>
			</section>
			<section data-background-color="#efeff4" class="light">
				<img src="story-2.png" class="light" />
				<p class="center">By activating the change log layer, users can see who edit last.</p>
				<aside class="notes">You probably wonder is this accurate? In Dark since users are making changes to the AST
					instead of text representations, we are
					saved from "blame the person who installed the linter" problem.</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- Goal 3 -->
			<section id="solve3">
				<h2>Solving: How do I edit code in chunks?</h2>
				<aside class="notes">All Dark code is already in production, everything a user writes is immediately deployed.
					There are no local or staging environments.</aside>

				<blockquote>Users need to be able to make changes to their codebase without affecting their customers
					immediately. And they need to package their changes for another to review or deploy.</blockquote>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
				<aside class="notes">Dark lacks the traditional git branches in most contemporary code bases. It is
					difficult for users to make changes in their code base that won't immediately affect production.</aside>
				<p><a href="https://darklang.github.io/docs/feature-flags" target="_blank">Feature Flags</a> provide a method
					users can change and test out their code, before enabling it for all their users. But as of now, they can only
					flag individual chunks of code.</p>
				<img src="teamwork-3-a.png" />
			</section>
			<section>
				<div>But new features or fixes often span across multiple parts of the codebase.</div>
				<aside class="notes">For example, let's say they add a new field to a database. They have to update POST
					endpoints to include the new field as input, as well as anywhere that performs <code>SELECT *</code> on the
					schema will
					have to handle the new column being fetched.</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<blockquote>How can we extend feature flags to group changes together and allow someone to review all changes
					associated with the new feature?</blockquote>
				<ol>To do so it would need to do two things:
					<li>Provide support for batching changes under a single feature flag.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Provide support to review the changes in a feature flag<aside class="notes inline">,
							UI to request changes or approve changes. And also support for deploying them.</aside>
					</li>

			<section data-background-color="#efeff4" class="light">

				<h3>Go live! (Rollout)</h3>
				<blockquote>Rollout is the proccess in with code in the feature flag replaces existing code. After rollout is
					complete the flag becomes inactive</blockquote>
				<ul>There are several different rollout options:
					<li class="fragment">Gradual rollout<aside class="notes inline"> will first execute this code for a certain
							percent of grandusers, and slowly increasing the percent until 100%. At any point during this rollout
							process, if reports of errors or other problems occur, you may pause this rollout process.</aside>
					</li>

					<li class="fragment">Scheduled rollout<aside class="notes inline"> will have all 100% of grandusers use the
							new code at a specific date-time. ie: The hour of a week when granduser traffic is at lowest.</aside>
					</li>

					<li class="fragment">Immediate rollout<aside class="notes inline"> will have Dark deploy the new code ASAP as
