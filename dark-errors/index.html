				<h1>Finding errors in your code</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

				<p>I worked with a backend developer to tackle this problem. I was responsible for designing a solution and
					implementing the frontend changes.</p>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<aside class="notes"> A differentiating feature of Dark is always seeing what code evaluates to for real data.
					This often overlaps with debug functionality, and we needed a clear way to message several error types when
					appropriate, including X Y Z. <br /><br />
					The example below shows how query parameters from a GET request are accessed and transformed from strings to
					integers.</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_lv-1.png" />
					<p>This is from a request made to <code>/test?a=1&b=2&c=3</code></p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_lv-2.png" />
					<p>You can pass data into functions and have them evaluated</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_lv-3.png" />
					<p>And these live values are kept, and gets propagated through for later evaluation</p>
				</div>

				<p>Live values shows the developer what exactly will happen to the data passed into their software.</p>

			</section>
			<section id="empathize">
				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>Dark's structured editor prevents developers from entering syntactically invalid code. But they still can
					have semantically invalid code.</p>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-1.png" />
					<p>Since the queryParams are <code>?a=1&b=2&c=3</code>, d is not defined and therefore resulting in
						<code>null</code>.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-2.png" />
					<p><code>String::toInt</code> expects you to pass in a <code>String</code> as an argument but gets a
						<code>null</code>. Therefore the <code>let d =</code> assignment equates to an error.</p>
				</div>

			</section>
			<section>
				<p>When errors will propagate to other parts of the code, and those expressions will not evaluate because it
					sees an error in its input. <em>Soon all of the live values will be shown with errors all over, even if the is
						just a single error in your codebase.</em></p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-3.png" />
					<p>Since <code>d</code> is an error, any evaluation involving d will also result in the same error.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-4.png" />
					<p>And the same error propagates through to other areas of the code.</p>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The of the way the Dark evaluation engine is engineered is that later expressions don't get evaluated, and
					the original error carries through.</p>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="eval_error_prop.png" style="background-color: #eee; border-radius: 8px;" />
					<p>Dark's evaluation engine will just carry the same error throughout the code.</p>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section id="brainstorm">
				<q>How do we help developers find the origin of theirs errors?</q>
				<p>Firstly, we want to alert the users when there is a semantic error.</p>
				<p>Secondly, if the error is propagated from another place in the code, we want to make it loud and clear where
					the error came from.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Signaling error in expression</h4>
				<p>Let's look at the first case. Many code editors either highlight the line number on the
					left, or show it on the right.</p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="swift-ex.png" />
					<p>The same example is written in Swift. XCode's playground has something similar to our live values; it
						highlights errors on the right near where the evaluated results are shown.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Unfortunately, the sides of the Dark editor is already used, and we don't want to overload those spaces with
					more information.</p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="sides.png" />
					<p>To the left of the we have live values, and the Error Rail to the right.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Furthermore, putting the error indicator on the sides will not capture, instances where there's multiple
					errors on the same line. Unless we design our error messaging to list out each case clearly.</p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_on-same-line.png" />
					<p>This example has and error on the right and left of the +. They are different errors on the same line.</p>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>So far, our editor borrows many ideas from Google Doc's editing experience. So I decided to borrow a pattern
					many people (including non-developers) are familiar with. The red swivel line from a text editor.</p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="same-line-error.png" />
					<p>Expressions that produce errors get a red dashed line.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The expressions which produce errors are now highlighted with a dashed red line.</p>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="just-underline.png" />
					<p>The function call <code>String::toInt</code> produces an error and we denote it by giving it an error
						marker.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Signaling when the error came from elsewhere</h4>

				<aside class="notes">Now what do we do, if the error came from another place in the code. First I didn't want to
					highlight places
					the error is propagated to because it will suggest to the developer, that they will have to fix multiple
					problems when they might only have to fix just one.</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_highlighting-props.png" />
					<p>Even though this is technically correct by illustrating the place there are errors. It poorly conveys what
						the developer will have to do to fix those errors. </p>
				</div>

				<q>If we are not going to highlight the places, where errors are propagated to then how will developers know
					that the error they are seeing crept up to earlier parts of their code?</q>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Here live values come to the rescue! Errors values will show in live values.</p>
				<aside class="notes"> If the developer is has their cursor on a place with a propagated error we will change the
					subtle dashed red line to an annoying blinking background. Signaling to them that "HEY THIS IS WHY YOUR
					EXPRESSION WON'T EVALUATE, GO FIX IT NOW."</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_sol-1a.gif" />
					<p>If the cursor position's live value is a propagated error. We want to make sure the developer will notice
						the origin of it.</p>
				</div>


				<div class="fragment image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_sol-2.gif" />
					<p>Clicking on the live value will bring the cursor to the end of error's origin expression (and stop
						blinking)</p>

					<aside class="notes">In case the code is very long or the origin error is hidden above the page's fold. They
						can click on the live value and the editor will take them the to origin error, and placing the cursor at the
						end of the expression so they can fix it.</aside>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Testing & Revisions</h2>
				<p>At first, I didn't want to confuse the user with the propagated error message since the problem with
					<code>sum * diff</code> is not "String::toInt was called with the wrong type", but "the second argument of *
					is called with the wrong type". Therefore I made it necessary for the developer to go to the live value of the
					origin error to see the error message.</p>
				<aside class="notes">But it turns out this annoyed developers, because they had to click to see the error. And
					we realized because we have the arrow pointing to the origin error's line. They won't be confused. So I
					changed it to show shows the origin error's message in the propagated error's live value. We want the original
					error message to be shown if the error propogated down.</aside>
				<img src="errors_sol-3.png" />
			</section>

			<section id="retro">
				<h2>Retrospective & Future Improvements</h2>
				<p>One common complaint we also get is that the blinking is too loud, they know there is an error and plan to
					fix it later. I think this falls under the scope of problems with our editor. It has no awareness of whether
					the user is writing code or debugging their code.</p>

				<p>Maybe we don't want to annoy the user when they are writing code, and only blink when they are debugging.
					This can be accomplished by tracking each user's typing speed to figure out their average speed. If they are
					typing significantly below their average speed, then consider them to be debugging.</p>

				<p>Another simple fix is that maybe having the arrow pointing to the line of the original error is enough to
					signal where it came from and we don't need to blink in an annoying fashion.</p>
