				<h1>Finding errors in your code</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

				<p>I worked with a backend developer to tackle this problem. I was responsible for <em>designing a solution</em>
					and
					<em>implementing the frontend</em> changes.</p>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<aside class="notes"> A differentiating feature of Dark is, you can always see what code evaluates to given your
					input data.
					This often overlaps with debug functionality, and we needed a clear way to message several error types when
					appropriate.<br /><br />
					The example below shows how query parameters from a GET request are accessed and transformed from strings to
					integers and used for evaluation later in the program.</aside>

				<div class="side-by-side" style="width:100%;">
					<div class="image-with-caption" style="align-items: flex-end;">
						<img src="errors_lv-1.png" />
						<p>This is from a request made to <code>/test?a=1&b=2&c=3</code></p>
					</div>
					<div class="image-with-caption" style="align-items: flex-end;">
						<img src="errors_lv-2.png" />
						<p>You can pass data into functions and have them evaluated</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="side-by-side">
					<div class="image-with-caption" style="align-items: flex-end;">
						<img src="errors_lv-3.png" />
						<p>Live values are kept, propagates through for later evaluation</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Live value shows the developer what exactly will happen to the data passed into
					their software.</p>

			</section>
			<section id="empathize">
				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>Dark's structured editor prevents developers from entering syntactically invalid code. But they still can
					have <em>semantically invalid code</em>.</p>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-1.png" />
					<p>Since the queryParams are <code>?a=1&b=2&c=3</code>, d is not defined and therefore resulting in
						<code>null</code>.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_prob-2.png" />
					<p><code>String::toInt</code> expects you to pass in a <code>String</code> as an argument but gets a
						<code>null</code>.</p>
				</div>

				<aside class="notes">Therefore the <code>let d =</code> assignment equates to an error.</p>

			</section>
			<section>
				<aside class="notes">When errors will propagate to other parts of the code, and following expressions will not
					evaluate because it
					sees an error in its input.</aside>
				<p>Many live values will be shown with errors all over, even if there is
					just a single error in your codebase.</p>

				<div class="side-by-side" style="width:100%;">
					<div class="image-with-caption">
						<img src="errors_prob-3.png" />
						<p>Since <code>d</code> is an error, any evaluation involving d will also result in the same error.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="image-with-caption">
						<img src="errors_prob-4.png" />
						<p>And the same error propagates through to other areas of the code.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section data-background-color="#efeff4" class="light">
				<p>The of the way the Dark evaluation engine is engineered is that later expressions don't get evaluated, and
					the original error carries through.</p>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="eval_error_prop.png" />
					<p>Dark's evaluation engine will just carry the same error throughout the code.</p>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section id="brainstorm">
				<blockquote>How do we help developers find the origin of theirs errors?</blockquote>
				<p>Firstly, we want to alert the users when there is a semantic error.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Secondly, if an error is propagated from another place in the code, we want to make it loud
					and clear where
					in came from.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Signaling error in expression</h4>
				<aside class="notes">Let's look at the first case.</aside>
				<p>Many code editors either highlight the line number on the
					left, or show it on the right.</p>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="swift-ex.png" />
					<p>The same example is written in Swift. XCode's playground has something similar to our live values; it
						highlights errors on the right near where the evaluated results are shown.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">Unfortunately, the sides of the Dark editor is already used, and we don't want to overload
					those spaces with
					more information.</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="sides.png" />
					<p>To the left of the we have live values, and the Error Rail to the right.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="fragment">
					<aside class="notes">Furthermore, putting the error indicator on the sides will not capture, instances where
						there's multiple
						errors on the same line. Unless we design our error messaging to list out each case clearly.</aside>

					<div class="image-with-caption">
						<img src="errors_on-same-line.png" />
						<p>This example has and error on the right and left of the +. They are different errors on the same line.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">So far, our editor borrows many ideas from Google Doc's editing experience. So I decided to
					borrow a pattern
					many people (including non-developers) are familiar with. The red swivel line from a text editor. That way we
					can highlight different errors on the same line.</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="same-line-error.png" />
					<p>Expressions that produce errors get a red dashed line.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="fragment">
					<aside class="notes">The expressions which produce errors are now highlighted with a dashed red line.</aside>
					<div class="image-with-caption">
						<img src="just-underline.png" />
						<p>The function call <code>String::toInt</code> produces an error and we denote it by giving it an error
							marker.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Signaling when the error came from elsewhere</h4>

				<aside class="notes">Now what do we do, if the error came from another place in the code. First I didn't want to
					highlight places
					the error is propagated to because it will suggest to the developer, that they will have to fix multiple
					problems when they only have to fix just one.</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_highlighting-props.png" />
					<p>They only have to fix <code>let d = String:toInt </code></p>
				</div>

				<p>Developers need to know
					that the error, they are looking at, had crept up from earlier parts of their code. <em>How can we signal
						that?</em></p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Here live values come to the rescue! Errors values will show in live values.</p>
				<aside class="notes"> If the developer is has their cursor on a place with a propagated error, the editor will
					change the
					subtle dashed red line to an annoying blinking background. Signaling to them that "HEY THIS IS WHY YOUR
					EXPRESSION WON'T EVALUATE, GO FIX IT NOW."</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_sol-1a.gif" />
					<p>If the cursor position's live value is a propagated error. We want to make sure the developer will notice
						the origin of it.</p>
				</div>


				<div class="fragment image-with-caption">
					<img src="errors_sol-2.gif" />
					<p>Clicking on the live value will bring the cursor to the end of error's origin expression (and stop
						blinking)</p>

					<aside class="notes">In case the code is very long or the origin error is hidden above the page's fold. They
						can click on the live value and the editor will take them the to origin error, and placing the cursor at the
						end of the expression so they can fix it.</aside>
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Testing & Revisions</h2>
				<aside class="notes">At first, I didn't want to confuse the developers with the propagated error message since
					the
					problem with
					<code>sum * diff</code> is not "String::toInt was called with the wrong type", but "the second argument of *
					is called with the wrong type". Therefore I made it necessary for the developer to go to the live value of the
					origin error to see the error message.<br /><br />
					But it turns out this added an extra step for developers, because they had to click to see the error. And
					we realized because we have the arrow pointing to the origin error's line. They won't will know that the
					message refers to a previous statement. So I
					changed it to show shows the origin error's message in the propagated error's live value.</aside>
				<div class="image-with-caption" style="max-width: 800px;">
					<img src="errors_sol-3.png" />
					<p>We want the original
						error message to be shown if the error propogated down.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="retro">
				<h2>Retrospective & Future Improvements</h2>

				<p>Blinking is too loud</p>
				<p>Context aware highlighting</p>
				<p>A list of all errors across the codebase</p>
				<aside class="notes">One common complaint we also get is that the <em>blinking is too loud</em>, they know there
					is an error and
					plan to
					fix it later. I think this falls under the scope of problems with our editor. It has no awareness of whether
					the user is writing code or debugging their code.<br /><br />

					Maybe we don't want to annoy the user when they are writing code, and only blink when they are debugging.
					This can be accomplished by tracking each user's typing speed to figure out their average speed. If they are
					typing significantly below their average speed, then consider them to be debugging.<br /><br />

					Another simple fix is that maybe having the arrow pointing to the line of the original error is enough to
					signal where it came from and we don't need to blink in an annoying fashion.<br /><br />

					Another nice to have is all like how at compile time, all errors are listed, across different functions and
					handlers. So you don't have to hunt for them.
