						<h1>Saxo</h1>
						<p>An expressive therapy app</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Research: user interviews, affinity map, storyboard, persona, empathy map</li>
						<li>Test prototype & revise</li>
						<li>Visual Design: mood board, style guide, animations, & prototype</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<blockquote>Therapy sessions can be expensive, how might we provide the benefits of expressive therapy in the comfort of your own space for free?</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>User research</h3>
					<p><small>I surveyed 10 people and interviewed 3 people, who enjoy doing some form of art for leisure. And also learn about people’s relationship with mental health.</small></p>
					<p>Learned about depression & anxiety cycle, and art therapy helps people struggling with depression.</p>
					<p>Art heals, but only when it's non-competitive, done in private, in the moment.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>I organized the research findings in an affinity map</small>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
					<blockquote>‘Body introspection’, a phrase one interviewee used stucked in my mind. They spoke of the joy from dancing on their own.</blockquote>

					<p> I decided to explore the relationship between movement and music.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="storyboard.png" style="height:500px" />
					<small>Storyboard of someone improvising music for their mindfulness activity</small>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<p>How can I prototype & test an interaction that relies on sound and motion in 2 days?</p>
					<p>I lacked motion sensor chips and Arduino while living abroad</p>
					<p>The sounds made must sound good, no matter how the user moves</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>But all I need to gauge people’s emotion response to the act of generating music by moving around.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<h4 class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">We can fake it!</h4>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><small>My Android phone had an accelerometer and gyroscope!</small></p>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><small>I download an obscure song. It will play when the device is in motion, and paused when still.</small></p>

					<h2>Testing</h2>

					<h3>Learnings</h3>
					<p>Using an unknown song did not fool people into thinking that they were improvising music.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless some users expressed the remixing popular songs would be just as fun as making new songs.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Revisions</h3>
					<p>If want to make an improv music app, there will be many untested wireframes still left to design.</p>
					<p>I decided to pivot and market it as a conducting music practice to help people struggling with anxiety feel in more control.</p>

				<section>
					<img src="empathy.png" style="height: 500px;" />
					<small>Iceberg of thoughts and feelings from someone about to have a panic attack</small>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="revise-wires.png" style="height: 500px;" />
					<p>After revising a few wireframes, it's time to move on to visual design</p>
				</section>

					<p>Afterwards we check in with how they are feeling</p>

					<h2>Retrospective</h2>
					<ul>Given more time and hindsight, I would...
						<li>Asked permission to take pictures of people’s reactions when I asked them to move my phone and test out the crude prototype. They were glorious.</li>
						<li>Gave myself more time, so I may prototype the improv mode.</li>
