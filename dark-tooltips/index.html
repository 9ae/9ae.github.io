				<section><h2>Backstory: Our new users problem</h2>
					<p>It is near impossible to learn Dark by exploration. New users would need the aid of our reference document or walkthrough videos.</p>
					<p>I've been a big advocate for in-editor onboarding from the start, but we were never able to make time for the project.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Why? The Navigator vs The Explorer</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Our initial business positioning rippled into our roadmap (and how we prioritized features).</p>
					<div class="fragment" style="width:100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
						<img src="pl.png" style="width:150px; margin-right: 20px;" />
						<p>Dark initially positioned itself as as a new language; it attracted attention from the programming languages community.<br />
							They approached new concepts with patience, willing to learn first before doing.
							<em>But they rarely ship projects in Dark.</em>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div  class="fragment" style="width:100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
						<p>Our most sucessful demographic turns out being new developers, students, and front-end or fullstack engineers.<br />
							<em>And they learn by doing!</em>
						</p>

					<h4>How can we tailor learning for the explorer?</h4>
					<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-up">Sample project tutorials. Most Javascript Frameworks start with a todo List tutorial, because many frontend engineers are explorers.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-up">Tooltips have been aiding people learn software through exploration. They provide additional information to what non-obvious icons mean, and suggest actions users can perform.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-up">Code sharing empowers users to learn from eachother and build upon eachother's knowledge.</li>

				<section>Inciting Incident: Task: ID visual problems that can be quick fixes (focus on leverage).
					In consistent tool tips.
				</section>
				<section>Investigation: ID "tooltips across the editor"</section>
				<section>Theory: Recognized that consistency is not just about style.
					We didn't end up here because each engineer that made a tooltip had a different aesthetic choice.
					Our tooltips server a variety of purposes.
				</section>
				<section> Theory:
					Drill down to their purpose & categorize.
					Also! We need to future proof, else we'll run into this problem again next time we need a helper message.
					* tooltips are most useful for new users & new features. We can use them for in-editor onboarding.
				</section>
				<section>
					Solution: Compo design (w/o detail message)
				</section>
				<section>
					Applied compo to existing & proposed tooltips.
					Ex: of existing tooltip updated
					Ex: of new tooltip we can used for onboarding
				</section>
				<section>
					Realized we need detail msg
				</section>
				<section>
					Pretty up: UI design
				</section>
				<section>
					Style spec, link to code pen. (whenever I'm uncertain about the feasibility of my own designs, I test it out first. Since I am the most senior web UI engineer @ Dark)
				</section>
				<section>
					Surprise! It got implemented even with onboarding tutorial.
				</section>
				<section>
					Retro: It's ok to let go of your ideas. Maybe they can still happen. You don't have to be the one to do everything.
