				<section><h2>Backstory: Our new users problem</h2>
					<p>It is near impossible to learn Dark by exploration. New users would need the aid of our reference document or walkthrough videos.</p>
					<p>I've been a big advocate for in-editor onboarding from the start, but we were never able to make time for the project.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Why? The Navigator vs The Explorer</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Our initial business positioning rippled into our roadmap (and how we prioritized features).</p>
					<div class="fragment" style="width:100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
						<img src="pl.png" style="width:150px; margin-right: 20px;" />
						<p>Dark initially positioned itself as as a new language; it attracted attention from the programming languages community.<br />
							They approached new concepts with patience, willing to learn first before doing.
							<em>But they rarely ship projects in Dark.</em>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div  class="fragment" style="width:100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
						<p>Our most sucessful demographic turns out being new developers, students, and front-end or fullstack engineers.<br />
							<em>And they learn by doing!</em>
						</p>

					<li class="fragment fade-up">Sample project tutorials. Most Javascript Frameworks start with a todo List tutorial, because many frontend engineers are explorers.</li>

					<p>We already have tooltips, but they are inconsistent in both style and behavior.</p>

					<h2>My role: Design consistent tooltips</h2>
					<p>How do we change existing tooltips to single style?</p>
					<p>How can we future-proof, so new tooltips will be in the same style?</p>

					<p><em>But consistency can't be achieved with just rigor to a style.</em></p>
					<p class="fragment">We did not get into this mess because every contributor had different aesthetic preferences. We got here because each new tooltip added aimed only to solve the current issue. Let's take a step back to understand what we were trying to achieve in the <em>past</em>, and what we want to achieve in the <em>future</em>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I approached this problem...</h2>
						<p class="left">First by scavanging across entire product to find all instances in which "tooltips" are used.</p>
						<p class="left">Then I categorized them by the function they serve.</p>
						<p  class="left">Lastly, theorized how we can use tooltips in the future to introduce Dark to new users, or highlight new features to seasoned users.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Taxonomize the chaos</h3>
					<p>Our editor has over 60 instances of tooltips, but they all fall into at least one of the four categories:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Labels -- provide text equivalents (in 5 words or less) to icons</li>
						<li>Descriptions -- explain UI elements in more detail in a few sentences</li>
						<li>Exceptions -- explain deviations from expected behaviors</li>
						<li>Suggested actions -- tells a user to do something to help them along</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Imagining a better world</h3>
					<p>Right now our tooltips have no memory.</p>
					<p>They will show regardless if the user had seem the before. This can be more obstructive than helpful to a seasoned user's workflow.</p>

					<p>If only we can determine the conditions they will appear in, then we can use them more often. And use them to help users learn Dark within the editor.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now that we know, what our tooltip component will need. And also what we want our component to be able to support. <em>Let's get designing!</em></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Define product requirements</h2>
					<img src="simple.png" />
					<p>What do all tooltips have? <em class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Text.</em></p>

					<img src="details.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" />
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">What type of text?<br /><em class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Always a short message, sometimes followed by a longer description.</em></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>and what else?</h3>
					CTA
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>when should they show?</h3>
					Trigger action
				</section>
				<section>
					Applied compo to existing & proposed tooltips.
					Ex: of existing tooltip updated
					Ex: of new tooltip we can used for onboarding
				</section>
				<section>
					What information is not capture here?
					Realized we need an exception UI
				</section>
				<section>
					Pretty up: UI design
				</section>
				<section>
					Style spec, link to code pen. (whenever I'm uncertain about the feasibility of my own designs, I test it out first. Since I am the most senior web UI engineer @ Dark)
				</section>
				<section>
					Surprise! It got implemented even with onboarding tutorial.
				</section>
				<section>
					Retro: It's ok to let go of your ideas. Maybe they can still happen. You don't have to be the one to do everything.
