				<section><h1>Onboard with context-aware with tooltips</h1></section>
				<section><h2>Backstory: Our new user problem.</h2>
					<blockquote> Onboarding as a theme.</blockquote>
					
					<p>Wanting in <a>editor</a> onboarding</p></section>
				<section>Inciting Incident: Task: ID visual problems that can be quick fixes (focus on leverage).
					In consistent tool tips.
				</section>
				<section>Investigation: ID "tooltips across the editor"</section>
				<section>Theory: Recognized that consistency is not just about style.
					We didn't end up here because each engineer that made a tooltip had a different aesthetic choice.
					Our tooltips server a variety of purposes.
				</section>
				<section> Theory:
					Drill down to their purpose & categorize.
					Also! We need to future proof, else we'll run into this problem again next time we need a helper message.
					* tooltips are most useful for new users & new features. We can use them for in-editor onboarding.
				</section>
				<section>
					Solution: Compo design (w/o detail message)
				</section>
				<section>
					Applied compo to existing & proposed tooltips.
					Ex: of existing tooltip updated
					Ex: of new tooltip we can used for onboarding
				</section>
				<section>
					Realized we need detail msg
				</section>
				<section>
					Pretty up: UI design
				</section>
				<section>
					Style spec, link to code pen. (whenever I'm uncertain about the feasibility of my own designs, I test it out first. Since I am the most senior web UI engineer @ Dark)
				</section>
				<section>
					Surprise! It got implemented even with onboarding tutorial.
				</section>
				<section>
					Retro: It's ok to let go of your ideas. Maybe they can still happen. You don't have to be the one to do everything.
