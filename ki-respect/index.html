				<section>
					<blockquote>“Online dating sucks”, is a phrase you commonly hear from any New Yorker, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.</blockquote>
					<p>When asked to ask why, the reason often refers to the way people treat each other in the dating scene.</p>
					<h4>Why do so many people feel their dating experience to be so unpleasant?</h4>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Online dating opens doors, it shrinks the miles, bridges social divides. It brings people who may not have the chance to run into each other in their daily lives, into awareness of each other existence. However it also gives you the impression that your options are limitless. The better option may be just one swipe away. <em>People become reduced to profiles.</em></p>

					<p class="fragment">Coffee Meets Bagel started their business by selecting for you one profile to review a day. As a result, their users often treat each other with more respect than users on Tinder or OKCupid, which gives user almost an boundless sea of fish. I decided to borrow a page from their book, with some modifications.</p>

					<h3>A feature solution: Daily matches!</h3>
					<img src="daily2.jpeg" />
					<p>Like Tinder, a mutual like is considered a match!</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<img src="daily1.jpeg" />
						<p>But you can <em>only have up to 7 matches a day</em>. After that we will stop showing you profiles, and encourage you to chat with your matches.</p>
					</div>
					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Only mutual likes will count towards your daily match limit.</h4>
					<p>A phrase I commonly hear from one segment of the users is “Coffee Meets Bagel does not work!” Since women tend to be more selective of who they “like”, mutual matches are less common for lesbians and straight men.</p>
					<p class="fragment">	
						Instead of giving you a set number of profiles to review daily, we will show you as many users who fits your preference criteria. Until you’ve found 7 people who likes you back.

					<h2>Testing</h2>

					<p><small>Originally our profile screens was a very much like Tinder, where we present to you one profile at time.</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>And we learned...</h4>
					<p>While daily matches feature was received, the profile swipe UI was less favored. After our first round of user testing, I conducting a second round of user interviews. </p>
					<p class="fragment">From those interviews, I’ve discovered people prefer the OKCupid method. <em>They don’t want to make a decision about someone on the spot.</em> There is a lot more go into consideration, when choosing a new play partner to engage in a scene with other than just physical attraction.</p>

						<h2>Revisions</h2>
						<p class="left">I made a prototype for the discovery feature with segment.io integration. It allowed me to analyze user actions, and make  tweaks to the prototype to test again. From analytics results, I’ve learned we need to provide more feedback to when liked/skipped profiles are hidden. You can also <a href="http://www.app.trykinkedin.com/test/discover.framer/" target="_blank">try it out.</a></p>
