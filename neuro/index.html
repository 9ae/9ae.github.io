				<h2>Experiment Control Creator</h2>
				<p>Empowering scientist to create hardware controlled experiments<br />
					@ Stony Brook University' s Neuroscience Dept. 2012</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Once upon a summer</h3>
				<aside class="notes">before heading out into the real world, I wanted to audit a literature class. But to do
					that I had to remain affliated with the university, my Visualizations TA came to the rescue and recommended me
					to take over a position he had with the Neuroscience Department. Where...
					/ They measured
					the electrical activity in the brains of thirsty rats, who were trained to press a lever upon hearing a tone.
					[!]
				</aside>

				<p>a professor and a post-doc wanted to find out which neurons fire upons in your brain when you are
					<em>expectating</em> a reward.
				</p>
				<div class="fragment">
					<img src="setup.png" style="max-height: 500px;" />
					<aside class="notes">The machine that controls when we send signals to play tones, release water valve, and
						detect lever press has an API in Python. The previous programmer, who worked with had wrote them a program
						which records the timestamps of when events happen, and connected the program to the API.</aside>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The classic experiment is to give the rat a drop of water at the start of a trial. Play tone. During the
					reward interval, if the rat presses the lever, she'll get another drop of water.</p>
				<img src="ClassicExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 8px;" />

				<p>There's a bunch of ways users want to vary the experiment.</p>
				<img src="VarExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 8px;" />
				<aside class="notes">And apparently that's why the lab needed a programmer.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Inherited Program</h4>
				<img src="prev_software.png" style="max-height: 350px;" />
				<p>Since the actions and intervals controlling the hardware was hard coded, the code hand to change everytime
					experiment designs changed. </p>
				<aside class="notes">And this was before version control was widely used. So if we wanted to go back to do an
					experiement we did last week, I had to find the old code and replace it. We did a hacky version control where
					we made multiple copies, with minor tweaks.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>It was not sustainable!</h1>
				<!-- POSITION AS HOW IT REPLIED ON THE USERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY TRACK WHICH EXPERIMENT HAD WHAT CONDITIONS, AND WAS RUN WHEN.
					WE RAN INTO PROBLEMS SEVERAL TIMES, WHERE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT WAS DONE WE DISCOVERED WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TRIALS DIDN'T LINE UP.
					-->
				<aside class="notes">And left a lot of room for human error to conduct the experiment wrong, might have changed
					variables without recording the change. So next time they want to run the experiment they might have forgotten
					to note the time change. I brought this problem up to the professor I was working for....</p>
					<p>Scientist should be able to run their experiments anytime without needing to edit code.</p>
					<!-- TODO ratouille mess -->

				<aside class="notes">
					and proposed a making an experiment creator. He thought it was an interesting idea, so over the weekend I made
					a paper prototype to test with him and our post-doc on Monday.
				</aside>
				<h4>How about we make an experiment creator?</h4>
				<p>An experiment design is just a sequence of events, over a time period. They can be broken down into
					<em>intervals</em> (wait, tone, reward, no-go) and <em>actions</em> (deliver treat).</p>

						</td>
						<td><img src="exe_file.png" style="height: 300px;" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<small>Experiments they designed are saved in files, and can load into the execution program.</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">After playing around with the prototype, they gave me the go-ahead to build this framework.
				</aside>
				<img src="rat_typing.gif" />
				<p>and three weeks later...</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">I had something they can try out and play with.</aside>
				<h3>Experiment Editor</h3>
				<small>Intervals can be added, edited, and deleted.</small><br />
				<img src="editInterval.png" style="max-height:200px" /><br />

				<small>and set times to dispense rewards freely</small><br />
				<img src="addReward.gif" style="max-height:200px" />
				<!-- TODO GIF should be run experiment -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>User testing, bug fixing, and soldering...</h4>
				<p>The editor built didn't provide affordance to re-arrange intervals.</p>
				<img src="rearrange.gif" style="max-height: 120px;" <p>And also included a new field in the tone interval to
				allow for the tone to be played in different
				frequencies.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">While the post-doc tested it out and created experiments, I fixed bugs she discovered. And
					also spent a week soldering because we ran out of wires with the probes we use to stick into rat brains.
				</aside>
				<h2>Wait?! What if you want to loop or jump intervals?</h2>
				<p>With the experiment editor, Lucinda was able to run and accumulate data faster than before. She got around to
					thinking of new variations, that she'll like to try:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What if when the rat fails to wait for reward, we play tone again instead of restarting the trial?</li>
					<li>What if I gave the rats different types of water depending on how soon they press the lever?</li>
					<li>What if I want to do the tone & reward intervals over and over again until the subject gets it right?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Our linear experiment editor doesn't support that (T.T)</p>
			</section>

			<!--
			<section>
				<aside class="notes">I initially tried to fit conditions into the interval editor. But it just end up confusing
					our user.</aside>

			<section>
				<h1>Enter the graph editor</h1>
				<!-- TODO graph editor -->

			</section>

			<section>
				<!-- TODO execution with graph of a conditional experiment -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<div>The editor will allow scientist to define experiments by:
					<ul>
						<li>When to play tone (and its frequency)</li>
						<li>When to make the rat wait</li>
						<li>When to deliver reward</li>
						<li>Save experiment logic and run trials any time</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<em>and they can do all this with anyone editing any code.</em>

			<section>
				<h1>On to greater evils...</h1>
				<p>Afterwards the stipend of the position ended, they were able to save money for their project, by not needing
					to hire another programmer.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>What I didn't know back then</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Version control</li>
					<li>Design thinking</li>
