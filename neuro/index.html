					<h2>Abstract Experiment Designer</h2>
					<p>Empowering scientist to create hardware controlled experiments<br />
					@ Stony Brook University's Neuroscience Dept. 2012</p>
				</section>
				<section><h3>Once upon a summer</h3>
					<aside class="notes">before heading out into the real world, I wanted to audit a literature class. But to do that I had to remain affliated with the university, my Visualizations TA came to the rescue and recommended me to take over a position he had with the Neuroscience Department. Where...</aside>

					<p>a professor and a post-doc wanted to find out which neurons fire upons <em>expectations.</em> They measured the electrical pulses in the brains of rats.</p>
					<!-- TODO ratoulle picture -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Thristy rats are trained to press a lever when they hear a tone.</p>
					<!-- TODO diagram of experiment control -->
					<aside class="notes">The machine that controls when we send signals to play tones, release water valve, and detect lever press has an API in Python. The previous programmer, who worked with had wrote them a program which records the timestamps of when events happen, and connected the program to the API.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>The code kept changing as experiment designs changed</h4>
					<!-- screenshot of software -->
					<p>Since the commands controlling the hardware was hard coded. Every time they wanted to change the order of events fired. We had to change the code.</p>
					<aside class="notes">And this was before version control was widely used. So if we wanted to go back to do an experiement we did last week, I had to find the old code and replace it. We did a hacky version control where we made multiple copies, with minor tweaks.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>It was not sustainable!</h1>
					<aside class="notes">I'm a lazy person, who likes to minimize work for myself and other people. I brought this problem up to the professor I was working for....</p>
					<!-- TODO ratouille mess -->
				</section>

					<aside class="notes">
						and proposed a making an experiment creator. He thought it was an interesting idea, so over the weekend I made a paper prototype to test with him and our post-doc on Monday.
					</aside>
					<h2>How about we make an experiment creator?</h2>
					<!-- TODO paper prototype -->
					<p>Scientist should be able to run their experiments anytime without needing to edit code.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Experiments they designed are saved in files, that they can load into the execution program.</p>
					<!-- Show wireframe of execution mode -->
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">After playing around with the prototype, they gave me the go-ahead to build.</aside>
					<img src="rat_typing.gif" />
					<p>and three weeks later...</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">I had something they can try out and play with.</aside>
					<h3>Experiment Editor</h3>
					<!-- TODO gifs of builder -->
					<!-- Create intervals -->
					<!-- move intervals around -->
				</section>

				<section>
					<div>The editor will allow scientist to define experiments by:
						<ul>
							<li>When to play tone (and its frequency)</li>
							<li>When to make the rat wait</li>
							<li>When to deliver reward</li>
							<li>Save experiment logic and run trials any time</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<em>and they can do all this with anyone editing any code.</em>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">While the post-doc tested it out and created experiments, I fixed bugs she discovered. And also spent a week soldering because we ran out of wires with the probes we use to stick into rat brains.</aside>
					<h2>Wait?! What about conditions?</h2>
					<p>After running many trials of a few experiments she made, she thought of a experiment flow she's never tried before. <em>What if I gave the rats different types of water depending on how soon they press the lever?</em></p>

					<p>Our linear experiment editor doesn't support that (T.T)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">I initially tried to fit conditions into the interval editor. But it just end up confusing our user.</aside>
					<!-- TODO split intervals -->
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Enter the graph editor</h1>
					<!-- TODO graph editor -->

				</section>

				<section>
					<!-- TODO execution with graph of a conditional experiment -->
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h1>On to greater evils...</h1>
					<p>Afterwards the stipend of the position ended, they were able to save money for their project, by not needing to hire another programmer.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What I didn't know back then</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Version control</li>
						<li>Design thinking</li>
