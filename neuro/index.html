				<h4>Experiment Creation Framework</h4>
				<p>Empowering scientist to create hardware controlled experiments<br />
					@ Stony Brook University' s Neuroscience Dept. 2012</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					So some context, even though I chat about this project a lot. It's the first time I presented it in a
					professional setting. Because it was such a long time ago, and before the start of my career as either an
					engineer or designer. A lot of ignorant technical mistakes were made, and you'll probably see throughout the
					project. But the framework I end up making here
					felt relevant to your product, even if it is a
					special case of the problem space. And if I talked exclusively about Dark, I risk putting 50% of
					the audience to sleep.
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h4>Once upon a summer</h4>

				<p>a professor and a post-doc wanted to find out which neurons fire upons in your brain when you are
					<em>expectating</em> a reward.
				</p>
				<div class="fragment">
					<img src="setup.png" style="max-height: 500px;" />
					<aside class="notes">They measured
						the electrical activity in the brains of thirsty rats, who were trained to press a lever upon hearing a
						tone. This machine controls when we send signals to play tones, release water valve, and
						detect lever press.</aside>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Inherited Program</h4>
				<img src="prev_software.png" style="max-height: 350px;" />
				<p>Connects to hardware to record events. Has UI for debugging. Most of the logic controlling the experiment
					protocol is not visible.</p>
				<aside class="notes">Neurolink had a Python library to interact with it. The previous
					programmer, who
					(was my Visualizations TA and recommend me for the job)
					had wrote a program which connects to the hardware
					and records the timestamps when events happen.</aside>

				<h3>How do the experiments work?</h3>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="ClassicExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 4px;" />
					<p>The classic experiment is to give the rat a drop of water at the start of a trial.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="VarExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 4px;" />
					<p>The No-Go interval tests restraint, where the rat will only get a drop of water if she doesn't press the
						lever.</p>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					Explains Classic:<br />
					Play tone. During the
					reward interval, if the rat presses the lever, she'll get another drop of water.
					<br /><br />
					There's a bunch of ways they want to vary the experiment. And apparently that's why the lab
					needed a programmer. Because the logic to determine when
					to play tone, give reward upon lever press was all hard coded. So everytime they want to try a different
					protocol, I'll need to modify the code.
					<br /><br />
					What ended up happening frequently was:
					The post-doc and interns runs one protocol for experiment over a few days. They collect the data, and then ask
					me to modify the code for the next type of experiment they want to run. I did so, then run a week later. They
					come back with some discrepencies in their data, and need to run more trials with previous protocol again. And
					since we were obvious to version control, I just had to change the code and hope it behaved exactly the same.

				<h4>Is this how science really happens?!</h4>
				<img src="ratatouille.jpg" style="max-height: 400px; border-radius: 8px;" />
				<aside class="notes">I know it's not, because I spent a previous summer meticulously measuring the momentum of
					muons. <br /><br />
					The experiment protocol was recorded in a notebook, leaving a lot of room for human error. I brought this
					concern up to the professor.</aside>
				<p>Scientist should be able to run their experiments anytime consistently.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">
					I proposed a making an experiment creator. He thought it was an interesting idea, so over the weekend I made
					a prototype to test with him and our post-doc on Monday. My idea is to create a protocol editor where you can
					create and edit experiments by defining intervals and actions. They are saved in a file, and can be loaded
					into the experiment control program to run the experiments. This way when you want to retry a protocol, you
					know it's consistent with the last time you ran it.
				</aside>
				<h4>How about we make an experiment creator?</h4>
				<p>An experiment protocol is just a sequence of events, over a time period. They can be broken down into
					<em>intervals</em> (wait, tone, reward, no-go) and <em>actions</em> (deliver reward).</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="rough_editor.png" style="height: 300px;" />
						</td>
						<td><img src="exe_file.png" style="height: 300px;" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<small>Experiments they designed are saved in files, and can load into the execution program.</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>After playing around with the prototype, they gave me the go-ahead to build this framework.</p>
				<img src="rat_typing.gif" style="max-height: 180px;" />
				<p>and three weeks later...</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">I had something they can try out and play with.</aside>
				<h4>Protocol Editor</h4>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="editInterval.png" style="max-height:200px" />
					<p>Intervals can be added, edited, and deleted.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="exe_exp.png" style="max-height:200px" />
					<p>Protocols can be loaded to run anytime.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>User testing, bug fixing, and soldering...</h4>
				<aside class="notes">
					They used it to create different protocols. Help find edge causes my initial implementation missed. During the
					bug-free and no feature request days I help make the connector wires because I automated myself out of the
					job.
				</aside>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="rearrange.gif" style="max-height: 120px;" />
					<p>The editor built didn't provide affordance to re-arrange intervals.</p>
				</div>

				<p style="text-align: left;">And also included a new field in the tone interval to allow the tone to be played
					at different frequencies.</p>

				<p style="text-align: left;">Add different types of water in the valve (can we make the rats become sugar
					addicts?)</p>

				<aside class="notes">While the post-doc tested it out and created experiments, I fixed bugs she discovered.
					Added new features such as tone frequency and select valve for reward. And
					also spent a week soldering because we ran out of wires with the probes we use to stick into rat brains.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Wait?! What if you want to loop or jump intervals?</h4>
				<p style="text-align: left;">With the experiment editor, they was able to run and accumulate data faster than
					before. And also got
					around
					to
					thinking of new variations to try. Some I had trouble modeling.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Can we jump to another interval?</h4>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="go_back.png" />
					<p>What if when the rat fails to wait for reward, we play tone again instead of restarting the trial?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="jump_around.png" />
					<p>What if we want to skip the rest of the reward period, and go to another tone once the rat presses the
						lever?</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>What about conditional rewards?</h4>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="diff_rewards.png" />
					<p>What if I gave the rats different types of water depending on how soon they press the lever?</p>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">I tried represent these new requirements into the existing framework, but just end up
					confusing the users more.</aside>

				<blockquote>What is the essence of these new protocols? What is our user trying to express?</blockquote>
			</section>

			<section>

				<p style="text-align: left;">Jumping to another interval breaks the timeline analogy we have been using in our
					editor to express trial
					time.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="jump_around.png" style="height: 50px; display: inline-block;" />
					<img src="go_back.png" style="height: 50px; display: inline-block;"" />
				</div>

				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Triggering actions based on time within is a desire for conditional
					control.
					<code>
						<font color=" #00cc88">do</font> give reward,
					<font color="#00cc88">if</font> lever pressed <font color="#00cc88">&</font> t > 5 
					</code>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">It seems as if we are hitting the bounds of what our framework's vocabulary can express.
					</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Defining new primatives</h3>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="jump_action.png" />
					<p style="text-align: left;">I added Jump as
						an action, then attached a conditional to it, to only trigger if the condition is true.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="interval_slots.png" style="max-height: 150px;" />
					<p>Then gave slots to
						an interval (at start, on lever press, when end) that can contain actions.</p>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">Then the professor pointed out that Reward and NoGo can be represented as intervals, under
					the new
					framework.
				</aside>
				<div class="image-with-caption">
					<img src="just_wait.png" style="max-height: 200px;" />
					<p>Reward and No Go can be represented as intervals.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Generalizing</h4>
				<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: flex-start;text-align: left; ">
					<img src="simple_tone.png" style="max-height: 150px; margin-right: 20px;" />
					<span>If we make a "Play Tone" action, then we can get rid of typed intervals all
						together.</span>
				</div>

				<p style="text-align: left;">And to provided even greater flexibility, I got rid of begin/lever/end slots in the
					intervals, and just allowed
					them to hold any number of conditions.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<em>Intervals</em> have <em>conditions</em>, when evaluated true, <em>actions</em> are triggered.</blockquote>

				<aside class="notes">An impedious for pushing for max flexibility of this framework is also motivated by the
					fact it's mid August, and my time
					with them is coming to an end. So I was highly motivated to provide for them a solution they can use for
					a long time.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Final primatives</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Intervals</em> no longer typed, they just hold an array of conditions</li>
					<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><em>Conditions</em> Lever pressed? Or time checks:
						<code>t > 2</code>, <code>T > 10</code>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><em>Actions</em> Reward, Play tone, Jump (to another interval)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="width: 444px; height: 180px; position: relative; margin: 0 auto;">
					<img src="new_interval.png" style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 0;" />
					<img src="new_condition.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"
						style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 1;" />
					<img src="new_action.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"
						style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 2;" />
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">I realized we were making miniature control graphs, with our new primatives. So why not go
					all the way.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Enter the graph editor</h4>
				<img src="graph_editor.png" style="max-height: 600px;" />

			</section>

			<!-- TODO execution with graph of a conditional experiment -->

			<section>
				<h3>On to greater evils...</h3>
				<p>Afterwards the summer position ended, the lab did not have to hire another programmer because faculty and
					students were able
					to
					make experiment protocols themselves.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4 style="text-align: left;">What I didn't know back then</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Version control</em> might have solved the problem</li>
					<li><em>Design thinking</em> practices could have prevented having to switching model
						representation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h4 style="text-align: left;">Reflection</h4>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Was the framework and GUI editor excess? Could we just have
					easily
					solved the
					problem with just writing a
					library of functions? And taught that to the scientist?</p>

				<!-- <p style="text-align: left;"><em>Trade-offs</em> Moving from the interval editor to the graph editor, provided
					more
					flexibility and expressive
					power to the framework. However, it did introduce greater complexity.</p>
				<aside class="notes">If my target users weren't
					scientist, who possess great analytical ability. I would not have made the switch in the editor interface.
