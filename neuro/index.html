				<h4>Experiment Control Creator</h4>
				<p>Empowering scientist to create hardware controlled experiments<br />
					@ Stony Brook University' s Neuroscience Dept. 2012</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Once upon a summer</h4>
				<aside class="notes">before heading out into the real world, I wanted to audit a literature class. But to do
					that I had to remain affliated with the university, my Visualizations TA came to the rescue and recommended me
					to take over a position he had with the Neuroscience Department. Where...
					/ They measured
					the electrical activity in the brains of thirsty rats, who were trained to press a lever upon hearing a tone.
					[!]
				</aside>

				<p>a professor and a post-doc wanted to find out which neurons fire upons in your brain when you are
					<em>expectating</em> a reward.
				</p>
				<div class="fragment">
					<img src="setup.png" style="max-height: 500px;" />
					<aside class="notes">The machine that controls when we send signals to play tones, release water valve, and
						detect lever press has an API in Python. The previous programmer, who worked with had wrote them a program
						which records the timestamps of when events happen, and connected the program to the API.</aside>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The classic experiment is to give the rat a drop of water at the start of a trial. Play tone. During the
					reward interval, if the rat presses the lever, she'll get another drop of water.</p>
				<img src="ClassicExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 8px;" />

				<p>There's a bunch of ways users want to vary the experiment.</p>
				<img src="VarExp.png" style="height: 100px; border-radius: 8px;" />
				<aside class="notes">And apparently that's why the lab needed a programmer.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Inherited Program</h4>
				<img src="prev_software.png" style="max-height: 350px;" />
				<p>Since the actions and intervals controlling the hardware was hard coded, the code hand to change everytime
					experiment designs changed. </p>
				<aside class="notes">And this was before version control was widely used. So if we wanted to go back to do an
					experiement we did last week, I had to find the old code and replace it. We did a hacky version control where
					we made multiple copies, with minor tweaks.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>It was not sustainable!</h4>
				<!-- POSITION AS HOW IT REPLIED ON THE USERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY TRACK WHICH EXPERIMENT HAD WHAT CONDITIONS, AND WAS RUN WHEN.
					WE RAN INTO PROBLEMS SEVERAL TIMES, WHERE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT WAS DONE WE DISCOVERED WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TRIALS DIDN'T LINE UP.
					-->
				<aside class="notes">And left a lot of room for human error to conduct the experiment wrong, might have changed
					variables without recording the change. So next time they want to run the experiment they might have forgotten
					to note the time change. I brought this problem up to the professor I was working for....</p>
					<p>Scientist should be able to run their experiments anytime without needing to edit code.</p>
					<!-- TODO ratouille mess -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">
					and proposed a making an experiment creator. He thought it was an interesting idea, so over the weekend I made
					a paper prototype to test with him and our post-doc on Monday.
				</aside>
				<h4>How about we make an experiment creator?</h4>
				<p>An experiment design is just a sequence of events, over a time period. They can be broken down into
					<em>intervals</em> (wait, tone, reward, no-go) and <em>actions</em> (deliver treat).</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="rough_editor.png" style="height: 300px;" />
						</td>
						<td><img src="exe_file.png" style="height: 300px;" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<small>Experiments they designed are saved in files, and can load into the execution program.</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>After playing around with the prototype, they gave me the go-ahead to build this framework.</p>
				<img src="rat_typing.gif" style="max-height: 180px;" />
				<p>and three weeks later...</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">I had something they can try out and play with.</aside>
				<h4>Experiment Editor</h4>
				<small>Intervals can be added, edited, and deleted.</small><br />
				<img src="editInterval.png" style="max-height:200px" /><br />

				<small>and set times to dispense rewards freely</small><br />
				<img src="addReward.gif" style="max-height:200px" />
				<!-- TODO GIF should be run experiment -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>User testing, bug fixing, and soldering...</h4>
				<p>The editor built didn't provide affordance to re-arrange intervals.</p>
				<img src="rearrange.gif" style="max-height: 120px;" />

				<p>And also included a new field in the tone interval to
					allow for the tone to be played in different
					frequencies.</p>
				<!-- TODO screen -->

				<p>Add different types of water in the valve (can we make the rats sugar addicts?)</p>
				<!-- TODO screen -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<aside class="notes">While the post-doc tested it out and created experiments, I fixed bugs she discovered.
					Added new features such as tone frequency and select valve for reward. And
					also spent a week soldering because we ran out of wires with the probes we use to stick into rat brains.
				</aside>
				<h4>Wait?! What if you want to loop or jump intervals?</h4>
				<p>With the experiment editor, Lucinda was able to run and accumulate data faster than before. She got around to
					thinking of new variations, that she'll like to try.</p>

				<aside class="notes">I initially tried to fit the new requirements into the interval editor. But end up
					confusing the user.</aside>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>What if when the rat fails to wait for reward, we play tone again instead of restarting the trial?</p>
				<img src="go_back.png" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>What if I gave the rats different types of water depending on how soon they press the lever?</p>
				<img src="diff_rewards.png" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>What if we want to skip the rest of the reward period, and go to another tone once the rat presses the
					lever?</p>
				<img src="jump_around.png" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<blockquote>What is the essence of these new experiements? What is our user trying to express?</blockquote>

				<p>Jumping to another interval breaks the timeline analogy we have been using in our editor to express trial
					time.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="jump_around.png" style="height: 50px; display: inline-block;" />
					<img src="go_back.png" style="height: 50px; display: inline-block;"" />
				</div>

				<p>Triggering actions based on time within interval time is a desire for conditional control.
					<code>
						<font color=" #00cc88">do</font> play tone,
					<font color="#00cc88">if</font> t > 5
					</code>
					</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>I added Jump as
					an action, then attached a conditional to it, to only trigger if the condition is true.</p>
				<img src="jump_action.png" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Then gave slots to
					an interval (at start, on lever press, when end) that can contain actions.</p>
				<img src="interval_slots.png" style="max-height: 150px;" />

				<p>Then the professor pointed out that Reward and NoGo can be represented as intervals, under the new framework.
				</p>
				<img src="just_wait.png" style="max-height: 200px;" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: center;">
					<span>So if we make a "Play Tone" action we can get rid of typed intervals all together.</span>
					<img src="simple_tone.png" style="max-height: 150px;" />
				</div>

				<p>And to provided even greater flexibility, got rid of begin/lever/end slots in the intervals, and just allowed
					them to hold any number of conditions.
					<em>Intervals</em> have <em>conditions</em>, when evaluated true do <em>actions</em>.</p>

				<aside class="notes">An impedious for pushing for max flexibility is also because its mid August, and my time
					with them is coming to an end. So I was also highly motivated to provide for them a solution they can use for
					a long time.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Redefined primatives</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Intervals</em> no longer typed, just holds an array of conditions</li>
					<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><em>Conditions</em> Is lever pressed? Or time checks:
						<code>t > 2</code>, <code>T > 10</code>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><em>Actions</em> Reward, Play tone, Jump (to another interval)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="width: 444px; height: 180px; position: relative; margin: 0 auto;">
					<img src="new_interval.png" style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 0;" />
					<img src="new_condition.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"
						style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 1;" />
					<img src="new_action.png" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"
						style="position: absolute; top:0; left: 0; z-index: 2;" />
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Enter the graph editor</h4>
				<p>I realized we were making miniature control graphs, with our new primatives. So why not go all the way.</p>
				<!-- TODO graph editor -->

			</section>

			<section>
				<!-- TODO execution with graph of a conditional experiment -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>On to greater evils...</h4>
				<p>Afterwards the stipend of the position ended, they were able to save money for their project, by not
					needing
					to hire another programmer.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>What I didn't know back then</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Version control</li>
					<li>Design thinking</li>
					<li>Maybe this would have sufficed as a library of functions</li>

				</ul>
				<p>Trade-offs: Moving from the interval editor to the graph editor, provided more flexibility and expressive
					power to the framework. However, it did introduce greater complexity. If my target users weren't
					scientist, who possess great analytical ability and came with an pre-existing understanding of boolean
					logic. I would not have made the switch in the editor interface.</p>
